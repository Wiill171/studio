/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Avis Explorer.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own profile data and associated bird sighting records.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored in `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Bird sightings are stored as subcollections under each user's profile in `/users/{userId}/sightings/{sightingId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly disallowed to prevent unauthorized enumeration of user accounts.
 * - All write operations (create, update, delete) are strictly limited to the owning user.
 * - Read operations are allowed only for the owning user.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `userProfileId` field in the `BirdSighting` entity is validated to match the `userId` in the path. This ensures that a sighting is always associated with the correct user.
